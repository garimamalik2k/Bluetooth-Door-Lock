# Bluetooth-Door-Lock

This project is to make the process of locking and unlocking a door remotely through Bluetooth connection with an Android phone. It has been programmed in the Arduino IDE such that a user input of 'C' in the Bluetooth Terminal Android application would lock the door and 'O' would unlock it. 
The Android application used for exchanging signals from the Android phone to the Arduino was custom-built using Android Studio.
